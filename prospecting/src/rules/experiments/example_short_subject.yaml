# Example experiment: Short subject lines
# This demonstrates how experiments can override base config

# Override subject lines with shorter versions
subjects:
  capa:
    - "CAPA backlog"
    - "CAPA closure"
  
  audit_readiness:
    - "Audit prep"
    - "Inspection ready?"
  
  batch_release:
    - "Batch delays"
    - "Release time"

# Optionally adjust constraints for this experiment
constraints:
  default_profile:
    subject_word_max: 3  # Even shorter subjects
