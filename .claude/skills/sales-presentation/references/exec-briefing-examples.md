# Executive Briefing Slide Examples

Examples of effective executive-level sales slides for quality/manufacturing deals.

## Slide 1: Current State Cost

### Structure
- **Header**: Problem statement with total cost
- **Left column**: Cost breakdown with bullet points
- **Right column**: Visual placeholder for process diagram

### Example: Manufacturing Quality Costs

**Header:** "Manual Quality Processes Cost $679,000/Year"

**Left column:**
- QA Labor Inefficiency: $250,000/year
  - 2 FTE reviewers × $125K × 80% time on manual review
- Documentation Error Cost: $81,000/year
  - 5% error rate × 4,800 batches × $350 rework cost
- Deviation Administrative Burden: $70,000/year
  - 780 deviations/year × 3 hours × $30/hour
- Audit Preparation Time: $78,000/year
  - 26 audits/year × 100 prep hours × $30/hour
- Compliance Risk Exposure: $200,000/year
  - Potential FDA warning letter, shipment holds

**Right column:** Process diagram showing manual workflow

### Key Principles
- Lead with total cost in header (grab attention)
- Use specific numbers, not ranges ($250K not "$200-300K")
- Show calculation basis (builds credibility)
- Keep bullets scannable (1-2 lines each)

## Slide 2: Solution Value & ROI

### Structure
- **Header**: ROI headline with payback period
- **Left column**: Annual savings breakdown
- **Right column**: 3-year financial summary

### Example: Value Proposition

**Header:** "5.8:1 ROI with 5.3 Month Payback"

**Left column - Annual Savings ($495K/year):**
- QA Efficiency (80% time savings): $200,000/year
  - Review-by-exception vs line-by-line review
- Error Elimination (90% reduction): $72,900/year
  - Digital capture eliminates transcription errors
- Deviation Reduction (80% reduction): $56,000/year
  - Alternate BOM eliminates planned deviations
- Audit Efficiency (50% faster prep): $39,000/year
  - Electronic records accelerate compliance
- Vendor Consolidation: $40,000/year
  - Replace existing QMS/complaints tools

**Right column - 3-Year Financial Summary:**
- Investment (Year 1): $220,000
- Annual Value: $495,000
- Payback Period: 5.3 months
- 3-Year Net Value: $1,265,000
- 3-Year ROI: 5.8:1

### Key Principles
- Lead with ROI/payback (CFO's primary question)
- Conservative savings percentages (80-90%, not 100%)
- Show 3-year view (SaaS standard)
- Highlight mechanism (how savings are achieved)

## Slide 3: Decision Framework

### Structure
- **Header**: Clear recommendation
- **Content**: Action items and timeline

### Example: Next Steps

**Header:** "Recommendation: Proceed with Implementation"

**Implementation Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Setup & Configuration
  - System configuration
  - User training (2 days)
  - Data migration
- Month 3-4: Pilot Deployment
  - Launch with 2 production lines
  - Validate ROI assumptions
  - Gather user feedback
- Month 5: Full Rollout
  - Deploy to all 14 production lines
  - Final QA team training
  - Go-live support

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Pilot validates ROI before full rollout
- Reference customers: 8 similar pharma/nutraceutical manufacturers
- Implementation team: Dedicated CSM + technical specialist

**Decision Criteria Met:**
✅ ROI > 3:1 (achieved 5.8:1)
✅ Payback < 12 months (achieved 5.3 months)
✅ Conservative estimates (80-90% savings vs potential 95%+)

### Key Principles
- Clear recommendation (don't make them guess)
- Address risk proactively (pilot, references)
- Show decision criteria met (if known)
- Concrete timeline (builds confidence)

## Formatting Guidelines

### Typography
- **Slide titles**: 32pt, bold, dark gray or white (on colored bg)
- **Section headers**: 18-20pt, bold, brand color
- **Body text**: 14pt, dark gray
- **Numbers/metrics**: Bold, brand color for emphasis

### Colors (Company Brand)
- **Primary teal** ([Brand Primary Color]): Headers, accents, key numbers
- **Purple** ([Brand Secondary Color]): Secondary accents, highlights
- **Dark gray** (#4E4E50): Body text
- **White** (#FFFFFF): Text on colored backgrounds
- **Light backgrounds**: #F5F5F5, #DDEEFF (for callout boxes)

### Spacing
- **Margins**: 20pt padding on all sides
- **Line height**: 1.5-1.8 for readability
- **Column gap**: 20pt between columns

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Most important**: Header with key metric
2. **Secondary**: Financial summary box or total cost
3. **Supporting**: Bullet point details
4. **Context**: Small text with calculation basis

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Vague value statements**
- "Improve efficiency" → ✅ "80% reduction in QA review time ($200K/year)"

❌ **Feature-focused bullets**
- "AI-powered analytics" → ✅ "Reduce error rate from 5% to <0.5% (save $73K/year)"

❌ **Walls of text**
- Paragraph explanations → ✅ Scannable bullets with metrics

❌ **Generic stock photos**
- Clip art people → ✅ Process diagrams or leave placeholder for customer data

❌ **Unsupported claims**
- "10x ROI" without calculation → ✅ "5.8:1 ROI = ($495K × 3 years - $220K) / $220K"

❌ **Too many decimals**
- $250,432.17 → ✅ $250,000 (round to thousands for readability)
