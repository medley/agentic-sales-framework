## Question Sequencing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Funnel (Broad to Specific)
**Use when:** Customer is engaged and you want to dive deep

**Sequence:**
1. "How does this compare to your current process?" (broad)
2. "What specific pain points does this address?" (narrowing)
3. "If we implemented this, what would change for your team?" (specific impact)
4. "What concerns do you have about adoption?" (objection handling)

---

### Strategy 2: Validation Loop (Show → Ask → Confirm)
**Use when:** You want to validate fit iteratively

**Sequence:**
1. **Show:** Demonstrate feature (2-3 min)
2. **Ask:** "Does this solve [specific pain]?" (30 sec)
3. **Confirm:** "So if this works as shown, you'd use it for [scenario]?" (30 sec)
4. Repeat for next feature

---

### Strategy 3: Stakeholder Round-Robin
**Use when:** Multiple stakeholders with different priorities

**Sequence:**
1. Demonstrate use case (5 min)
2. Ask business stakeholder: "Sarah, does this save time for your team?"
3. Ask technical stakeholder: "Mike, any concerns about how this integrates?"
4. Ask executive stakeholder: "Jennifer, does this impact your operational budget?"

**Goal:** Ensure all voices heard, surface diverse objections

---

### Strategy 4: Discovery Recovery (If Notes Sparse)
**Use when:** Demo reveals incomplete discovery

**Sequence:**
1. "Before I show more, help me understand: What's your current process?"
2. "What happens when [pain scenario] occurs?"
3. "How much time/cost does that create?"
4. "Who's most impacted?"
5. **Then** demonstrate solution with context

---

## Red Flag Questions (For AE/SE)

Ask these internally before demo to assess readiness:

**Deal Health:**
- "Have we confirmed Economic Buyer will attend?"
- "Do we know their budget and timeline?"
- "Is discovery complete, or are we guessing at pain?"
- "What's our win probability—are we the front-runner?"

**Demo Readiness:**
- "Which use cases matter most to this customer?"
- "What differentiates us from competitors they're evaluating?"
- "What objections do we expect, and how do we address them?"
- "What's our next-step ask—POC, trial, proposal?"

**Technical Readiness:**
- "Is the demo environment tested and working?"
- "Do we have customer-specific data loaded?"
- "What's our backup plan if the demo fails?"
- "Who's presenting what sections?"

---

## Post-Demo Validation Questions

**Immediately after demo (still on call):**
- "What did you like most about what you saw?"
- "What concerns remain?"
- "Who else needs to see this before you can decide?"
- "What are the next steps from your side?"

**Follow-up email (within 24 hours):**
- "Did the demo address your top priorities, or should we dive deeper on specific areas?"
- "What questions came up after the call that we should address?"
- "What's your internal timeline for making a decision?"
- "Can we schedule time next week to discuss [POC/trial/proposal]?"

---

## Customization Guide

**How to adapt questions for your specific deal:**

1. **Replace placeholders:**
   - `[specific workflow]` → "monthly compliance reporting"
   - `[pain point]` → "manual audit trail compilation"
   - `[role]` → "Director of Compliance"

2. **Use customer's language:**
   - If they say "audit prep," use "audit prep" (not "compliance documentation")
   - If they say "production stoppage," use "production stoppage" (not "downtime")

3. **Reference prior conversations:**
   - "You mentioned in discovery that..." (builds on history)
   - "Sarah said last week..." (shows you're listening)

4. **Quantify when possible:**
   - "You mentioned 40 hours per audit—does this reduce that to single digits?"
   - "If this prevents 2 compliance findings per quarter, what's the cost savings?"
