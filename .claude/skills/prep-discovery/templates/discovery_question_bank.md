# Discovery Question Bank

A curated collection of discovery questions organized by objective and methodology.

## Sandler Pain Funnel (8-Question Sequence)

Use this sequence for EACH pain point identified:

1. **"Tell me more about that..."**
   - Purpose: Open-ended expansion
   - Listen for: Breadth of the problem

2. **"Can you be more specific? Give me an example."**
   - Purpose: Get concrete details
   - Listen for: Real scenarios, not hypotheticals

3. **"How long has that been a problem?"**
   - Purpose: Assess urgency and priority
   - Listen for: "Years" = low urgency, "Weeks" = high urgency

4. **"What have you tried to do about that?"**
   - Purpose: Understand prior attempts and budget spent
   - Listen for: Investment already made, commitment level

5. **"And did that work?"**
   - Purpose: Confirm pain still exists
   - Listen for: Failed attempts = higher pain, frustration

6. **"How much do you think that has cost you?"**
   - Purpose: Quantify financial impact
   - Listen for: Specific numbers or willingness to estimate

7. **"How do you feel about that?"** ← MOST IMPORTANT
   - Purpose: Test emotional commitment
   - Listen for: "Frustrated," "concerned," "alarmed," "determined"
   - RED FLAGS: "Thinking about," "considering," "exploring"

8. **"Have you given up trying to deal with the problem?"**
   - Purpose: Assess commitment to solve NOW
   - Listen for: "No, we need to fix this" vs. "We've learned to live with it"

## Negative Reverse Questions (Sandler Technique)

**Purpose:** Reduce pressure, increase authenticity, test commitment

- "This may not be a fit for you..."
- "I'm not sure we can help with that..."
- "You should probably tell me 'no' if you're not 100% comfortable..."
- "It sounds like the timing might not be right..."
- "Maybe it makes sense to revisit this in 6 months?"

**When to Use:**
- When prospect seems non-committal
- When you sense intellectual vs. emotional interest
- To test their reaction (do they push back and sell YOU?)

**Red Flags (Don't Use If):**
- They're already highly engaged and qualified
- Too early in conversation (haven't established rapport)
- Could come across as manipulative

## Follow-Up & Next Steps Questions

### Closing the Discovery Call

- "What would be a logical next step if this seems like a fit?"
- "Is there anything that would prevent us from moving forward?" (if qualified)
- "Are we missing anything important that we should have covered?"

### Disqualification Questions
- "Is this something you're committed to solving in the next [timeframe]?"
- "If we can't [meet specific requirement], does that take us out of consideration?"
- "Are you just gathering information, or is there a real initiative here?"

### Commitment & Agreement

- "What would you need to see to move forward?"
- "Can we schedule the next conversation with [decision maker] present?"

## Question Sequencing Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```
Bad:  "Do you have a problem with data integration?"
Good: "Walk me through your current data management process..."
      → Listen for integration pain
      → "Tell me more about the integration challenges..."
```

### 2. Follow the Energy
If they light up about a topic, go deeper:
```
Them: "Our reporting is a nightmare..."
You:  "Tell me more about that..." [Pain Funnel Q1]
```

### 3. Listen 70%, Talk 30%
- Ask question
- LISTEN to full answer
- Don't interrupt with your solution
- Ask follow-up based on what they said

### 4. Emotional Language = Gold
When you hear "frustrated," "concerned," "alarmed," "worried":
```
You: "You mentioned you're frustrated with [X]. Help me understand -
      how does this impact YOU personally?"
```

### 5. Quantify Everything
- "How much time does this take?"
- "How much does this cost?"
- "How many people are affected?"
- "What's the financial impact?"

### 6. End with Clear Next Steps
- Don't leave discovery open-ended
- Either: Qualify and advance
- Or: Disqualify and exit gracefully

## Usage Tips

1. **Don't script word-for-word:** Use these as inspiration, adapt to your style
2. **Pick 5-7 questions per discovery call:** Don't overwhelm with 50 questions
3. **Customize to industry/role:** Technical buyer needs different questions than economic buyer
4. **Follow the conversation:** Don't stick rigidly to your list if a natural thread emerges
5. **Document answers:** Take notes or record (with permission) for later analysis
