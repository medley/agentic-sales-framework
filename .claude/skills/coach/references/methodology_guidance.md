# Methodology-Specific Coaching Guidance

Deep-dive on how to coach deals using different sales methodologies. Use this reference when adapting coaching tone, recommendations, and risk assessment to methodology frameworks.

## Sandler Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **No Free Consulting** - Never present solutions before pain/budget/decision are qualified
2. **Disqualification = Success** - Encourage walking away from bad-fit deals
3. **Pain Before Product** - Emotional pain drives decisions, intellectual interest doesn't
4. **Up-Front Contracts** - Set expectations for each interaction (agenda, outcomes, next steps)
5. **Negative Reverse Selling** - "Maybe this isn't a fit..." to uncover real objections

### Stage-Specific Coaching

**Stage 1: Bonding & Rapport**
- Focus: Build trust, establish peer relationship (not vendor/buyer)
- Exit Criteria: Mutual respect, stakeholder willing to be candid
- Red Flags: Stakeholder treating you as order-taker, no personal connection
- Coach Recommendation: Use self-deprecating humor, share relevant story, avoid premature pitch

**Stage 2: Pain (Discovery)**
- Focus: Uncover emotional pain, quantify cost of inaction
- Exit Criteria: Pain intensity 7+/10, stakeholder uses emotional language, personal impact clear
- Red Flags: Intellectual framing ("we're thinking about..."), pain below 5/10, vague problem
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Use Pain Funnel: "How long has this been a problem? What have you tried? What's it costing you? If you don't solve this, what happens?"
  - Look for emotional language: "frustrated", "worried", "keeping me up at night"
  - If pain insufficient: "It sounds like this might not be urgent. Should we reconnect in Q3?"

**Stage 3: Budget**
- Focus: Confirm budget exists, validate authority, align on investment range
- Exit Criteria: Economic Buyer confirms budget allocated or can reallocate, amount matches solution cost
- Red Flags: "We'll find budget if it makes sense", budget discussion deflected, champion but not EB confirms
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Direct question: "Have you thought about budget?"
  - If yes: "Is ${X} within range?" If no: "No problem, let's discuss what this is worth solving before we go further."
  - Sandler: If no budget, disqualify or help them build business case to secure it

**Stage 4: Decision**
- Focus: Map decision process, identify all stakeholders, understand approval chain
- Exit Criteria: Decision process documented (who, what, when), all decision-makers identified
- Red Flags: "We'll know when we see it", vague timeline, committee with no DRI
- Coach Recommendation:
  - "Walk me through the last time you made a purchase like this. Who was involved? How long did it take?"
  - Identify veto holders: "Who could say no and kill this?"
  - If unclear: "I'm concerned we'll waste your time if the process isn't clear. Can we map this out?"

**Stage 5: Fulfillment (Presentation)**
- Focus: Present solution ONLY after pain/budget/decision qualified
- Exit Criteria: Stakeholder agrees solution addresses pain, fits budget, aligns with decision criteria
- Red Flags: Stakeholder requesting demo before qualification, asking for proposal prematurely
- Coach Recommendation:
  - If qualification incomplete: Delay presentation until pain/budget/decision confirmed
  - During presentation: Tie every feature to pain uncovered in Stage 2
  - After presentation: "Does this solve the problem we discussed? If so, what's the next step in your process?"

### Coaching Tone & Language

**Do:**
- Use casual, peer-level language ("I'm not sure this is a fit...")
- Encourage disqualification ("Should we call it here?")
- Focus on emotional impact ("How does this affect you personally?")
- Challenge vague answers ("What does 'probably Q3' mean exactly?")

**Don't:**
- Sound overly formal or corporate
- Push for next steps without qualification
- Present solutions before pain/budget/decision qualified
- Accept vague commitments ("We're interested", "We'll get back to you")

## MEDDPICC Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **Metrics-Driven** - Quantify business impact in stakeholder's terms
2. **Economic Buyer = Decision** - Must engage decision-maker, not just influencers
3. **Checklist Discipline** - M-E-D-D-P-I-C must all be checked before forecasting
4. **Paper Process Visibility** - Map approval chain, signatures, timeline explicitly
5. **Champion Validation** - Champion must have power, influence, and willingness to sell internally

### MEDDPICC Breakdown

**M - Metrics**
- What: Quantified business outcomes (cost savings, revenue increase, time saved, risk reduced)
- Exit Criteria: Economic Buyer agrees on metrics, baseline established, success criteria defined
- Red Flags: Metrics provided by champion but not validated by Economic Buyer, vague metrics ("improve efficiency")
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Tie solution to Economic Buyer's OKRs or strategic goals
  - Quantify: "${X} saved per year", "Y% faster processing", "Z FTE redeployed"
  - Get Economic Buyer to state success criteria: "What ROI justifies this investment?"

**E - Economic Buyer**
- Who: Person with budget authority and decision power (usually C-suite or VP)
- Exit Criteria: Economic Buyer identified, engaged directly, validated pain/budget/metrics
- Red Flags: Champion says "CFO will approve", but CFO not engaged; Economic Buyer delegates entirely
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Directly ask champion: "Who controls the budget for this initiative?"
  - Request introduction: "Can you set up a 15-min call with [EB] to align on business outcomes?"
  - If EB won't meet: Major red flag, deal may not be real priority

**D - Decision Criteria**
- What: Specific, weighted criteria used to evaluate solutions (functionality, cost, vendor stability, implementation timeline)
- Exit Criteria: Decision criteria documented, weighted (must-haves vs nice-to-haves), Economic Buyer validated
- Red Flags: Champion provides criteria but Economic Buyer hasn't seen them; criteria favor competitor
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Ask: "What criteria will you use to evaluate solutions? How are they weighted?"
  - Influence criteria: Work with champion to add criteria that favor your strengths
  - Validate with EB: "Are these the criteria you'll use to make the final decision?"

**D - Decision Process**
- What: Timeline, approval steps, stakeholders involved, committee structure
- Exit Criteria: Process mapped (step-by-step), timeline agreed, next steps defined
- Red Flags: "We'll decide when we're ready", multiple committees with no coordination, timeline keeps slipping
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Map explicitly: "After technical validation, what happens? Who needs to approve? In what order?"
  - Identify blockers: "What could slow this down or kill it?"
  - Get commitment: "If we deliver X by Y date, will you commit to decision by Z?"

**P - Paper Process**
- What: Contract approval flow (Legal, Procurement, Finance, Exec signatures)
- Exit Criteria: Paper process mapped, timeline for each step, contact names for Legal/Procurement
- Red Flags: "Legal will be quick", no Procurement contact identified, MSA negotiation not anticipated
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Ask: "Once we agree on terms, what's the contract approval process? Who signs, in what order?"
  - Identify delays: "How long does Legal typically take? Any deal-killers in your MSA requirements?"
  - Get introductions: "Can you introduce me to your Procurement lead so we can align on process?"

**I - Identify Pain**
- What: Business problem driving evaluation (cost, risk, compliance, growth constraint)
- Exit Criteria: Pain quantified, personal impact to Economic Buyer, compelling event identified
- Red Flags: Pain described intellectually, no urgency, "nice to have" positioning
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Quantify: "What's this costing you today? What happens if you don't solve it?"
  - Personal impact: "How does this affect your goals/team/role?"
  - Compelling event: "Why now vs. next year?"

**C - Champion**
- Who: Internal advocate with power (influence), willingness (sell internally), and personal win (political or career benefit)
- Exit Criteria: Champion identified, validated they have influence, confirmed they'll sell internally
- Red Flags: Champion is junior with no decision influence; champion can't articulate personal benefit; champion won't commit to next steps
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Validate power: "When you recommend solutions, how often does leadership follow your advice?"
  - Confirm willingness: "Will you advocate for this internally, even if I'm not in the room?"
  - Identify personal win: "How does solving this help you personally (career, goals, team)?"

**C - Competition**
- Who: Competitors in evaluation (vendors, status quo, build in-house)
- Exit Criteria: All competitors identified, differentiation clear, champion confirms your positioning advantage
- Red Flags: "We're not looking at anyone else" (unlikely), competitor relationship stronger, evaluation criteria favor competitor
- Coach Recommendation:
  - Ask: "Who else are you evaluating? What do you like about them?"
  - Differentiate: Load battlecard, position strengths vs. competitor weaknesses
  - Status quo: "What's the cost of continuing as-is?" (often the real competitor)

### Coaching Tone & Language

**Do:**
- Use checklist discipline ("Let's review MEDDPICC...")
- Be metrics-focused ("What ROI justifies this?")
- Emphasize Economic Buyer engagement ("Have you confirmed this with the CFO?")
- Map paper process explicitly ("Who signs, in what order?")

**Don't:**
- Accept incomplete MEDDPICC (all 7 elements required)
- Forecast deals without Economic Buyer engagement
- Ignore competition (always assume competitors exist)
- Skip paper process mapping (causes late-stage delays)

## Generic B2B Methodology

### Core Principles

1. **Standard Qualification** - Stakeholders, pain, budget, decision, timeline (no jargon)
2. **Progressive Discovery** - Each stage builds on previous (no skipping)
3. **Stakeholder Coverage** - Economic Buyer, Champion, Technical minimum required
4. **Artifact-Driven** - Each stage has required outputs (discovery notes, proposal, demo deck)

### Stage Progression

**Stage 1: Discover**
- Focus: Identify pain, stakeholders, rough timeline
- Exit Criteria: Pain understood, champion identified, next meeting scheduled
- Coach Recommendation: Ask open-ended questions, map stakeholders, avoid premature solutions

**Stage 2: Qualify**
- Focus: Validate budget, decision process, compelling event
- Exit Criteria: Budget confirmed, Economic Buyer engaged, decision timeline clear
- Coach Recommendation: Direct budget question, request Economic Buyer intro, quantify cost of inaction

**Stage 3: Propose**
- Focus: Present solution, technical validation, pricing discussion
- Exit Criteria: Solution accepted, pricing in range, technical objections resolved
- Coach Recommendation: Tailor proposal to stakeholder priorities, address objections proactively

**Stage 4: Select**
- Focus: Competitive evaluation, stakeholder consensus, final decision
- Exit Criteria: Selected as preferred vendor, pricing agreed, contracting initiated
- Coach Recommendation: Differentiate from competitors, secure champion advocacy, prepare for procurement

**Stage 5: Negotiate**
- Focus: Contract terms, legal review, redlines
- Exit Criteria: MSA/SOW agreed, Legal approved, signatures pending
- Coach Recommendation: Anticipate legal objections, align on non-negotiables, expedite review

**Stage 6: Close**
- Focus: Final approvals, signatures, payment setup
- Exit Criteria: Contract signed, PO issued, handover to delivery complete
- Coach Recommendation: Coordinate signatures, prep handover, confirm implementation timeline

**Stage 7: Won**
- Focus: Celebrate, handover, implementation kickoff
- Exit Criteria: Deal marked closed-won, customer success engaged
- Coach Recommendation: Document lessons learned, ensure smooth delivery transition

### Coaching Tone & Language

**Do:**
- Use clear, jargon-free language
- Follow standard B2B practices (no methodology-specific terms)
- Focus on stakeholder engagement and timeline management
- Emphasize artifact creation (discovery notes, proposals, demo decks)

**Don't:**
- Assume methodology knowledge (keep it simple)
- Skip stages (progressive qualification required)
- Ignore Economic Buyer (always required for budget/decision)

## When to Recommend Methodology Adoption

If deal note specifies `methodology: none` or Generic, consider recommending methodology adoption when:

**Recommend Sandler if:**
- Sales team struggles with discounting (gives away value early)
- Deals have vague pain or urgency issues
- Sales team uncomfortable walking away from bad-fit deals
- Emotional selling needed (vs. technical/feature-focused)

**Recommend MEDDPICC if:**
- Enterprise deals with complex approval chains
- Forecast accuracy is a problem (deals slip frequently)
- Multiple stakeholders and unclear decision process
- Competition is intense (need differentiation discipline)

**Keep Generic if:**
- Sales team new to methodologies (don't overwhelm)
- Deals are transactional or SMB (less complexity)
- Methodology overhead not justified by deal size

## Usage in Coaching

When generating coaching reports:
1. Load methodology from deal.md frontmatter
2. Apply methodology-specific language, principles, and stage criteria
3. If methodology is Sandler: Emphasize pain intensity, disqualification, no free consulting
4. If methodology is MEDDPICC: Checklist M-E-D-D-P-I-C, emphasize Economic Buyer and metrics
5. If methodology is Generic: Use standard B2B language, focus on stakeholders/budget/timeline
6. Recommend skills aligned with methodology (e.g., Sandler → pain funnel questions in prep-discovery)

Load this reference when:
- User asks for methodology-specific coaching guidance
- Deal uses unfamiliar methodology (need deep-dive on principles)
- Otherwise, keep out of context (progressive disclosure)
