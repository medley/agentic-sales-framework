# Risk Indicators Reference

Comprehensive risk patterns for sales deal coaching. Use this reference when analyzing deal health and identifying potential blockers.

## Champion Departure Risk

**Indicators:**
- Champion role change announced or rumored
- Champion engagement frequency declining (weekly → monthly)
- Champion no longer responds within 48 hours
- Champion delegating your interactions to junior staff
- Champion missing from scheduled calls without explanation
- Organizational restructure affecting champion's department

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** Champion departed, no replacement identified
- 🟡 **High:** Champion role uncertain, engagement dropped 50%+
- 🟠 **Medium:** Champion engagement slowing but still responsive

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Immediately cultivate secondary champion (parallel relationship)
- Request introduction to champion's manager (upward relationship)
- Document champion's success criteria and share with stakeholders
- Accelerate deal timeline before departure (if imminent)

## Economic Buyer Disengagement

**Indicators:**
- Economic Buyer delegated evaluation entirely to team
- Economic Buyer canceled or no-showed executive alignment call
- Economic Buyer has not confirmed budget availability directly
- Economic Buyer unaware of deal progress (discovered via champion)
- Economic Buyer focused on different priorities (per recent company news)
- Economic Buyer not present in final decision discussions

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** Economic Buyer never identified or engaged
- 🟡 **High:** Economic Buyer engaged once, now disengaged
- 🟠 **Medium:** Economic Buyer engaged but delegating heavily

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Schedule executive briefing (15-min max, business outcomes only)
- Leverage champion to create Economic Buyer urgency
- Align solution to Economic Buyer's personal/organizational OKRs
- Identify compelling event tied to Economic Buyer's goals

## Competition Displacement Risk

**Indicators:**
- Competitor mentioned favorably by stakeholders
- Evaluation criteria heavily favor competitor's strengths
- Stakeholders referencing competitor's terminology/positioning
- Competitor has existing relationship (incumbent or partner)
- Procurement comparing your pricing to competitor's quote
- Technical evaluation focused on feature parity with competitor

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** Incumbent competitor with multi-year contract renewal approaching
- 🟡 **High:** Competitor actively engaged, stakeholder preference unclear
- 🟠 **Medium:** Competitor mentioned, no active engagement detected

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Load battlecard for competitor, identify differentiation
- Shift evaluation criteria to your strengths (via champion influence)
- Create urgency around competitor's weaknesses (risk, cost, timeline)
- Position as complementary vs. competitive if displacement unlikely

## Timeline Compression Risk

**Indicators:**
- Close date moved up significantly (e.g., Q4 → Q2)
- Stakeholder requesting proposal/pricing before discovery complete
- Customer bypassing standard procurement/legal review
- Executive pressure to "move faster" without clear compelling event
- Stakeholder unwilling to schedule adequate evaluation time
- Proposal deadline before technical validation complete

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** Artificial urgency with no business compelling event (budget burn, competitor threat)
- 🟡 **High:** Legitimate urgency but skipping qualification steps
- 🟠 **Medium:** Timeline aggressive but stakeholders committed

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Qualify compelling event (why now vs. next quarter?)
- Sandler: "I'm concerned we'll move too fast and miss critical requirements. What's driving the urgency?"
- If no compelling event: Slow down, risk of losing to "no decision"
- If legitimate event: Accelerate, but don't skip qualification (compress timelines in parallel)

## Budget Authority Gap

**Indicators:**
- Budget "should be available" but not confirmed by Economic Buyer
- Stakeholder deflecting budget questions ("we'll find it if it makes sense")
- Budget allocated to different initiative, requires reallocation
- Multi-year deal but budget only confirmed for Year 1
- Budget tied to executive approval that hasn't occurred
- Procurement negotiating price before budget confirmed

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** No budget discussion occurred, Economic Buyer not engaged on cost
- 🟡 **High:** Budget exists but authority unclear or requires executive approval
- 🟠 **Medium:** Budget confirmed by champion, awaiting Economic Buyer validation

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Sandler: "Have you thought about budget?" → If no, disqualify or move to budget conversation
- Direct question to Economic Buyer: "Is ${X} within your allocated budget for this initiative?"
- Identify budget approval process: who signs, what threshold requires C-suite approval?
- Confirm budget timing: available now, next quarter, fiscal year change?

## Decision Process Opacity

**Indicators:**
- Stakeholder can't describe decision-making process
- "We'll know it when we see it" (no criteria defined)
- Multiple stakeholders with veto power, no clear DRI (Directly Responsible Individual)
- Evaluation committee membership unclear
- Decision timeline vague ("probably Q3 sometime")
- Procurement involved but authority vs. influencer role unclear

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** No defined decision process, timeline, or criteria
- 🟡 **High:** Process described but stakeholders disagree on details
- 🟠 **Medium:** Process described, awaiting final validation from Economic Buyer

**Mitigation Actions:**
- MEDDPICC: Map paper process explicitly (who signs, in what order, by when?)
- Ask champion: "Walk me through the last time you purchased similar software. Who was involved? How long did it take?"
- Identify approval chain: Technical → Economic Buyer → Procurement → Legal → CFO?
- Get champion to drive internal alignment on decision criteria

## Deal Stagnation

**Indicators:**
- No customer interaction in 14+ days
- Deal in same stage for 30+ days (typical: 14-21 days per stage)
- Stakeholder saying "we're still evaluating" with no specific next steps
- Meetings canceled/rescheduled multiple times
- Champion not driving internal urgency
- No forward progress artifacts (no demo scheduled, no proposal requested)

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** 30+ days no contact, champion non-responsive
- 🟡 **High:** 14-30 days slow progress, meetings rescheduled
- 🟠 **Medium:** 7-14 days, stakeholder engaged but slow

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Re-qualify compelling event: "Has anything changed since we last spoke?"
- Sandler: "It seems like this might not be a priority right now. Should we revisit in Q3?"
- Offer to disqualify: If no urgency, free up your time and theirs
- Create urgency: Time-limited offer, competitive threat, risk of status quo

## Pain Intensity Insufficient

**Indicators (Sandler-specific, applicable to all methodologies):**
- Stakeholder using intellectual language: "We're thinking about...", "It would be nice to..."
- No emotional language: Frustration, fear, risk, urgency absent
- Problem existed for months/years without action (no catalyst)
- Pain rated below 7/10 when asked directly
- Stakeholder can't quantify cost of status quo (time, money, risk)
- Solution positioned as "nice to have" vs "must have"

**Severity Assessment:**
- 🔴 **Critical:** Pain below 5/10, no compelling event, intellectual framing only
- 🟡 **High:** Pain 5-7/10, some urgency but not personal to Economic Buyer
- 🟠 **Medium:** Pain 7+/10 for champion, awaiting Economic Buyer validation

**Mitigation Actions:**
- Sandler Pain Funnel: "How long has this been a problem? What have you tried? What's it costing you?"
- Escalate to personal impact: "If this doesn't get solved, what happens to your team/goals/role?"
- Quantify cost: "What's the financial impact of continuing as-is for another 6 months?"
- If pain insufficient: Disqualify or nurture until pain increases (external event, new mandate)

## Usage in Coaching

When generating coaching reports:
1. Scan deal state for indicators listed above
2. Rank detected risks by severity (Critical → High → Medium)
3. Cite specific evidence from deal.md or artifacts
4. Map each risk to mitigation actions (D1 or D7)
5. Recommend skills if artifact generation helps mitigation (e.g., battlecard creation, email outreach)

Load this reference when:
- User asks for detailed risk analysis
- Deal health assessment requires deep-dive
- Otherwise, keep out of context (progressive disclosure per skill-creator best practices)
