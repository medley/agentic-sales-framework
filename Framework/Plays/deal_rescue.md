# Deal Rescue Play: Stalled Deal Recovery

<triggers>
- no_activity_30_days (last touchpoint >30 days ago)
- timeline_slipped (expected close date passed, no update)
- ghosting (champion stopped responding)
- stuck_in_evaluation (prolonged "still evaluating" status)
- lost_momentum (deal was hot, now cold)
- champion_change (original champion left, deal at risk)
</triggers>

<principles>
- **Diagnose root cause**: Stall reason determines recovery approach (budget? priority? champion?)
- **Change the approach**: Doing same thing = same result (try new angle)
- **Offer to disqualify**: "Should we close this out?" (tests real interest)
- **Set deadline**: "Let's decide by [date] - yes, no, or not now" (force decision)
- **Fresh perspective**: Bring in different person (SE, exec, customer success) to re-engage
- **Accept loss gracefully**: Some deals can't be saved - disqualify and move on
</principles>

<steps>
1. **Diagnose the stall** (ask these questions):
   - **Timeline**: When did momentum stop? What was last interaction?
   - **Champion status**: Is champion still engaged? Still in role? Still interested?
   - **Budget**: Did funding get pulled? Reallocated to other projects?
   - **Priority**: Did business priority change? (new leadership, re-org, strategic shift)
   - **Competition**: Did competitor win? Are they evaluating alternatives?
   - **Decision process**: Is deal stuck in legal/procurement/approval hell?
   - **Value**: Do they still believe in ROI? Did business case weaken?

2. **Categorize stall type** (determines recovery strategy):
   - **Type 1 - Champion issue**: Champion left, lost influence, or stopped selling internally
   - **Type 2 - Budget issue**: Funding pulled, budget cut, competing priorities
   - **Type 3 - Priority shift**: Business priorities changed, project deprioritized
   - **Type 4 - Process stuck**: Legal, procurement, or approval process gridlock
   - **Type 5 - Value doubt**: Skepticism on ROI, competitive threat, buyer's remorse
   - **Type 6 - Ghosting**: No clear reason, just stopped responding

3. **Execute recovery strategy** (based on stall type):

   **Type 1 - Champion issue**:
   - Find new champion (ask departing champion for intro, or multi-thread to backup)
   - Escalate to exec sponsor (if champion lost influence, go higher)

   **Type 2 - Budget issue**:
   - Explore phased approach (start smaller, expand later)
   - Revisit ROI (show cost of inaction, reframe as investment vs expense)
   - Ask for next budget cycle timing (convert to pipeline for Q2/Q3)

   **Type 3 - Priority shift**:
   - Align to new priorities (if possible, reframe solution to new business goals)
   - Offer to pause gracefully (keep relationship, revisit when priority returns)

   **Type 4 - Process stuck**:
   - Escalate to business sponsors (legal/procurement gridlock needs exec intervention)
   - Simplify terms (offer standard contract, reduce negotiation complexity)

   **Type 5 - Value doubt**:
   - Bring in reference customer (peer validation of ROI)
   - Offer pilot (de-risk with proof of value)
   - Competitive intelligence (if competitor won, learn why)

   **Type 6 - Ghosting**:
   - Change the messenger (different person reaches out: SE, CSM, exec)
   - Offer to disqualify (last-ditch "Should we close this out?")

4. **Re-engagement outreach**:
   - **Pattern interrupt**: Don't send "just checking in" (boring, ignored)
   - **Value-add**: Send insight, benchmark, or case study (give reason to respond)
   - **Direct ask**: "Should we close this opportunity, or is there still interest?"
   - **Timeline**: "I'm updating our pipeline forecast. Where does this stand?"

5. **Set decision deadline**:
   - "Let's decide by [date] - yes, no, or revisit later. Which makes sense?"
   - Forces decision (vs perpetual "still evaluating")
   - If they miss deadline, disqualify and move on

6. **Know when to walk away**:
   - 60+ days no activity + no response to re-engagement = disqualify
   - Champion left + no new champion identified = disqualify
   - Budget pulled + no timeline for reinstatement = disqualify
   - Competitor won + no dissatisfaction with winner = disqualify
</steps>

<examples>
<example id="champion_departure_recovery">
**Context**: $1.2M deal, strong champion (Dir IT), deal in stage 5 (Negotiate), champion announces departure

**Situation**: Champion gave 3 weeks notice, deal at risk of dying

**Diagnosis**:
- **Stall type**: Champion issue (departure)
- **Risk**: High (deal in late stage, no backup champion)

**Recovery strategy**:
- **Week 1**: Asked departing champion "Who should take over? Can you intro me?"
- **Champion intro**: VP IT (champion's boss) + IT Manager (champion's team)
- **Week 2**: Met with VP IT and IT Manager, got context transfer
- **Week 3**: Champion's last week, confirmed VP IT as new exec sponsor

**Post-departure**:
- VP IT approved deal (exec sponsor authority)
- IT Manager continued as new champion (day-to-day driver)

**Outcome**: Deal closed 2 weeks after champion left (recovery successful)

**Key moves**:
- Caught departure early (3 weeks notice = time to multi-thread)
- Departing champion facilitated handoff (clean transition)
- Developed relationships with VP IT + IT Manager before departure
</example>

<example id="ghosting_recovery">
**Context**: $800K deal, champion ghosting for 45 days (stopped responding to emails/calls)

**Situation**: Last interaction was positive ("We're moving forward"), then silence

**Diagnosis**:
- **Stall type**: Ghosting (no clear reason)
- **Attempts**: Sent 5 follow-up emails, 3 voicemails (no response)

**Recovery strategy - Pattern interrupt**:
- **Changed messenger**: Had SE reach out (not AE)
- **SE email**:
  ```
  [Champion], I know [AE] has been trying to reach you. I wanted to check in from the technical side.
  We just released [new feature] that addresses [pain point you mentioned]. Worth a quick call?
  If timing isn't right, totally understand - we can revisit later.
  ```

**Champion response** (within 2 hours):
- "Sorry for going dark. We had internal re-org, this project got deprioritized. Let me connect you with new owner."

**New champion intro**: VP Ops (different department, fresh evaluation)

**Outcome**: Re-engaged with new champion, deal restructured at $600K (smaller scope, new department), closed 6 weeks later

**Key moves**:
- Pattern interrupt (SE vs AE, technical angle vs sales follow-up)
- Offered value (new feature) not just "checking in"
- Gave permission to say no ("if timing isn't right, we can revisit")
- Champion responded because SE made it easy (no pressure, just helpful)
</example>

<example id="budget_cut_recovery">
**Context**: $1.5M deal, CFO approved budget, then CFO announces company-wide budget freeze

**Situation**: Champion says "CFO pulled all non-essential spending. We're stuck."

**Diagnosis**:
- **Stall type**: Budget issue (freeze)
- **Timeline**: Indefinite (freeze could last 2-4 quarters)

**Recovery strategy - Phased approach**:
- **Proposed**: Start with $200K Phase 1 (critical department), defer $1.3M Phase 2 until freeze lifts
- **Positioning**: "Phase 1 solves immediate pain, generates ROI to fund Phase 2"

**Champion reaction**: "I can probably get $200K approved if I position it as cost savings"

**CFO pitch** (champion presented):
- Phase 1 investment: $200K
- Phase 1 savings: $350K/year (headcount redeployment)
- Payback: 7 months (within freeze period, self-funding)
- Phase 2: Fund from Phase 1 savings when freeze lifts

**CFO response**: "If it's self-funding in 7 months, approved."

**Outcome**: Phase 1 closed at $200K, Phase 2 ($1.3M) pipeline for Q3 (when freeze expected to lift)

**Key moves**:
- Adapted to budget reality (didn't fight the freeze)
- Phased approach made deal viable (small investment, fast payback)
- Positioned as cost savings (not new spending)
- CFO saw Phase 1 as self-funding (low risk)
</example>

<example id="priority_shift_recovery">
**Context**: $900K deal, CEO announces new strategic priority (digital transformation), our project (ops efficiency) deprioritized

**Situation**: Champion says "CEO's focus is digital transformation now. Ops projects are on hold."

**Diagnosis**:
- **Stall type**: Priority shift
- **Original positioning**: Operational efficiency (no longer top priority)

**Recovery strategy - Reframe to new priority**:
- **Analysis**: How does ops efficiency enable digital transformation?
- **Reframe**: "Digital transformation requires clean data. Our solution fixes data quality issues blocking your transformation."

**New pitch** (to champion):
- "Your CEO wants digital transformation. But if your data is messy (8% error rate), transformation will fail."
- "Our solution cleans data foundation (reduces errors to <1%), enabling reliable digital transformation."
- "Position this as Phase 0 of digital transformation (foundational), not separate ops project."

**Champion reaction**: "I never thought of it that way. Let me pitch it to CEO as digital transformation enabler."

**CEO response**: "Data quality is a blocker. Let's fix it as part of transformation."

**Outcome**: Deal approved at $900K, repositioned as digital transformation foundational project

**Key moves**:
- Listened to new priority (digital transformation)
- Reframed solution to align (data quality enables transformation)
- Champion pitched internally with new positioning
- CEO saw deal as aligned to strategic priority (not competing project)
</example>

<example id="disqualify_gracefully">
**Context**: $600K deal, stalled for 60 days, no response to re-engagement attempts

**Situation**: Champion stopped responding, no activity, no new champion identified

**Diagnosis**:
- **Stall type**: Ghosting + no recovery signals
- **Attempts**: 6 emails, 4 calls, SE outreach, exec outreach (all ignored)

**Recovery strategy - Offer to disqualify**:
- **Final email**:
  ```
  [Champion], I haven't heard back in 60 days. I'm assuming this isn't a priority right now.

  I'm going to close this opportunity in our system. If things change, feel free to reach out.

  No hard feelings - appreciate the time you invested in evaluating us.
  ```

**Champion response** (3 days later):
- "Apologies for ghosting. We went with a competitor. Appreciate your patience."

**AE follow-up**:
- "Thanks for letting me know. Can I ask what made you choose them? (Just to improve our approach)"

**Champion shared**:
- Competitor had stronger reference in our industry
- Pricing was 20% lower
- Integration with existing system was easier

**Outcome**: Deal lost, but learned why (reference gap, pricing, integration). Disqualified gracefully, kept relationship.

**Key moves**:
- Offered to disqualify (made it easy for champion to respond)
- No guilt trip (graceful exit)
- Asked for feedback (champion shared reasons)
- Learned from loss (improved future approach)
- Kept relationship intact (champion might buy in future)
</example>
</examples>

<pitfalls>
- **"Just checking in" emails**: Generic follow-ups get ignored (offer value instead)
- **Over-persistence**: Harassing champion with daily calls = burned relationship
- **Not diagnosing root cause**: Treating all stalls the same = wrong recovery approach
- **Refusing to disqualify**: Holding onto dead deals = wasted time, bloated pipeline
- **Same messenger**: Sending same AE 10 times vs trying SE or exec (pattern interrupt needed)
- **No deadline**: Perpetual "still evaluating" without forcing decision = eternal stall
</pitfalls>
