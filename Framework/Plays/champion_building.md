# Champion Building Play: Internal Advocate Development

<triggers>
- no_champion (friendly contacts but no one actively selling internally)
- weak_champion (lukewarm, not taking ownership)
- champion_departure_risk (job change, re-org, promotion out of role)
- single_threaded (only one champion, no backup)
- champion_lacks_authority (enthusiastic IC but no influence)
- deal_stalled (need internal advocate to drive urgency)
</triggers>

<principles>
- **Personal win > company win**: Champion needs career benefit (promotion, visibility, problem solved)
- **Test strength early**: Ask champion to do something (intro, data, meeting) - strong champions act
- **Enable, don't burden**: Give champion tools (slides, talking points, ROI calc) to sell internally
- **Multi-thread**: Cultivate 2-3 champions (primary + backup) to de-risk
- **Executive sponsor ≠ champion**: Exec sponsors approve, champions sell. You need both.
- **Champion criteria**: Access, credibility, urgency, willingness to act
</principles>

<steps>
1. **Identify potential champions** (look for these signals):
   - **Pain ownership**: They personally feel the problem daily
   - **Career motivation**: Project success = promotion, visibility, or problem solved
   - **Credibility**: Respected internally, trusted by leadership
   - **Access**: Can get meetings with Economic Buyer or decision committee
   - **Urgency**: Timeline pressure (OKR, deadline, board commitment)

2. **Test champion strength**:
   - **Small ask**: "Can you introduce me to [stakeholder]?" or "Can you share [data]?"
   - **Strong champion**: Acts within 48 hours, proactive
   - **Weak champion**: Says "yes" but doesn't follow through, or gives excuses
   - **Not a champion**: Says "I need to check with my boss first"

3. **Build champion relationship**:
   - **Understand personal win**: "What does success look like for you?" (not just company)
   - **Offer help**: "How can I make you successful?" (tools, data, executive access)
   - **Regular check-ins**: Weekly cadence, share insights/benchmarks (build trust)
   - **Give credit**: Champion gets public credit for project success

4. **Enable champion to sell internally**:
   - **Provide artifacts**:
     - 1-slide executive summary (champion presents to leadership)
     - ROI calculator (champion builds business case)
     - FAQ doc (champion answers objections)
     - Reference contact (champion calls peer company)
   - **Rehearse pitch**: Practice exec presentation with champion (role-play objections)
   - **Offer to ghost-write**: Draft emails, proposals, business case for champion

5. **Monitor champion health**:
   - **Green flags**: Proactive (reaches out first), multi-threading (introduces other stakeholders), urgency (pushes timeline)
   - **Yellow flags**: Reactive (waits for you to follow up), vague next steps, slow responses
   - **Red flags**: Ghosting, "need to check with boss", championing multiple vendors simultaneously

6. **Develop backup champions**:
   - Identify 2-3 additional stakeholders who benefit from solution
   - Build relationships in parallel (don't put all eggs in one basket)
   - If primary champion leaves, you have continuity
</steps>

<examples>
<example id="ops_manager_champion">
**Context**: $500K deal, selling to operations team, no clear champion yet

**Situation**: Met with 3 stakeholders (Dir Ops, Ops Manager, Analyst). Who's the champion?

**Champion testing**:
- **Dir Ops**: Friendly, interested, but said "let me know what you need" (passive)
- **Ops Manager**: Asked detailed questions, said "I've been trying to solve this for 2 years, this could get me promoted"
- **Analyst**: Enthusiastic but no decision authority

**Action**: Focused on Ops Manager (clear personal win = promotion)

**Enabling the champion**:
- **Week 1**: Shared ROI calculator, Ops Manager built business case showing $800K savings
- **Week 2**: Provided 1-slide exec summary, Ops Manager presented to Dir Ops (got buy-in)
- **Week 3**: Connected Ops Manager with reference customer (same role, got promoted after project success)
- **Week 4**: Ops Manager introduced AE to CFO, positioned as "strategic initiative I'm leading"

**Outcome**: Deal closed at $500K ACV, Ops Manager got promoted 6 months later (cited this project in promotion case)

**Key moves**:
- Identified personal win (promotion) and tied deal success to champion's career goals
- Tested strength early (Ops Manager acted fast, Dir Ops was passive)
- Provided tools (ROI calc, exec summary, reference) to enable internal selling
- Champion took ownership (presented to Dir Ops and CFO, not AE)
</example>

<example id="weak_champion_pivot">
**Context**: $1M deal, IT Director seemed like champion, but deal stalled in stage 2 (Qualify)

**Situation**: IT Director said "I love this" but hasn't taken any action in 3 weeks

**Champion test**:
- **Asked**: "Can you introduce me to your CIO for a 15-min strategic review?"
- **Response**: "Let me check with my boss first" (RED FLAG - weak champion)

**Action**: Pivoted to find stronger champion

**New approach**:
- **Asked IT Director**: "Who else feels this pain most urgently?"
- **Answer**: "Our VP Engineering is screaming about this every week"
- **Reached out to VP Engineering**: Found he had board-level OKR tied to solving this problem (URGENCY!)

**New champion** (VP Engineering):
- **Personal win**: Board OKR success = bonus + credibility with CEO
- **Test**: Asked for intro to CIO, VP Eng scheduled meeting same day (STRONG)
- **Enablement**: VP Eng drafted business case himself, asked AE to review (took ownership)

**Outcome**: VP Eng became champion, drove deal to close in 5 weeks (vs 3-week stall with IT Director)

**Key moves**:
- Recognized weak champion signals early (passive, needs approval)
- Asked current contact to help find stronger champion (didn't burn bridge)
- Found champion with urgency (board OKR = compelling event)
- Strong champion drove deal internally without needing to be pushed
</example>

<example id="champion_departure">
**Context**: $800K deal, strong champion (Dir Product), deal in stage 5 (Negotiate), then champion announces resignation

**Situation**: Champion gave 4 weeks notice, leaving before deal closes. Deal at risk.

**Action** (champion departure protocol):
- **Immediate**: Asked champion "Who should take over as internal sponsor?"
- **Champion suggested**: VP Product (his boss) + Product Manager (his team)
- **Transition plan**:
  - **Week 1**: Champion introduced AE to VP Product and PM in joint meeting, handed off context
  - **Week 2**: AE met 1:1 with VP Product (new exec sponsor) and PM (new champion)
  - **Week 3**: PM took ownership (continued driving internal approvals)
  - **Week 4**: Champion's last week, deal still in legal review (not closed yet)

**Post-departure**:
- VP Product became exec sponsor (approval authority)
- PM became new champion (day-to-day driver)
- Deal closed 2 weeks after original champion left

**Outcome**: Deal survived champion departure because of multi-threading and clean handoff

**Key moves**:
- Caught departure early (champion gave 4 weeks notice)
- Asked champion to facilitate handoff (didn't try to navigate politics alone)
- Developed relationship with both exec sponsor (VP) and new champion (PM)
- New champion had context and motivation (project was already in flight)
</example>

<example id="multiple_champions">
**Context**: $1.5M enterprise deal, complex buying committee (7 stakeholders across IT, Ops, Finance)

**Situation**: Need to build consensus across multiple departments. Can't rely on single champion.

**Strategy**: Cultivate 3 champions (one per department)

**Champions developed**:
1. **IT Champion**: Sr IT Manager (pain = legacy system technical debt, personal win = modernization project on resume)
2. **Ops Champion**: Dir Operations (pain = manual processes, personal win = efficiency gains for annual review)
3. **Finance Champion**: FP&A Manager (pain = budget visibility, personal win = CFO recognition)

**Coordination**:
- **Monthly sync**: All 3 champions + AE met to align on messaging and timeline
- **Divided responsibilities**:
  - IT Champion = technical validation and architecture approval
  - Ops Champion = business case and ROI justification
  - Finance Champion = budget approval and procurement
- **Each champion sold to their own leadership** (IT to CIO, Ops to COO, Finance to CFO)

**Outcome**: All 3 departments aligned, deal closed at $1.5M ACV with full consensus

**Key moves**:
- Identified champion per department (not single champion for complex deal)
- Each champion had personal win tied to their role (not generic)
- Coordinated messaging across champions (avoided conflicting narratives)
- Let each champion own their domain (AE supported, didn't drive)
</example>

<example id="ic_to_champion">
**Context**: $400K deal, individual contributor (IC) analyst is enthusiastic but has no decision authority

**Situation**: Analyst loves the product, but can't get exec buy-in (not a true champion yet)

**Action**: Elevate IC to champion by increasing their influence

**Approach**:
- **Understand IC's goal**: "What would make you successful in your role?"
- **IC answer**: "If I can bring innovative solutions to my boss, it shows initiative"
- **Positioning**: "What if you presented this to your boss as your recommendation? I'll give you everything you need."

**Enablement**:
- **Provided full business case**: ROI calc, competitive analysis, implementation plan
- **Rehearsed pitch**: Role-played IC presenting to their manager (built confidence)
- **Offered to ghost-write**: Drafted exec summary email for IC to send to boss

**IC's pitch to manager**:
- IC presented as "I found a solution to [problem], here's the business case"
- Manager was impressed by IC's initiative (exactly the career benefit IC wanted)
- Manager became exec sponsor, IC became champion (credibility increased)

**Outcome**: Deal closed at $400K, IC got recognition from leadership (career boost)

**Key moves**:
- Recognized IC's career motivation (show initiative, not just solve problem)
- Enabled IC to take credit (they presented, not AE)
- Built IC's credibility with their manager (elevated IC to champion status)
</example>
</examples>

<pitfalls>
- **Assuming friendliness = championship**: Nice stakeholder ≠ champion (test with asks, not assumptions)
- **Single-threading**: Relying on one champion = high risk if they leave or lose influence
- **Burdening champion**: Expecting champion to do all the work without enablement tools
- **Ignoring personal win**: Focusing only on company ROI, not champion's career benefit
- **Not testing strength**: Assuming someone is a champion without asking them to act
- **Wrong champion**: Enthusiastic IC with no influence < lukewarm exec with authority (both needed)
</pitfalls>
