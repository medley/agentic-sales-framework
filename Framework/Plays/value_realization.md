# Value Realization Play: ROI & Business Case Development

<triggers>
- pricing_objection ("This is too expensive")
- cfo_approval_needed (CFO must approve investment)
- budget_justification (champion needs to build business case)
- competing_priorities (limited budget, multiple initiatives)
- economic_buyer_engagement (need to speak CFO's language)
- board_approval_required (large investment, needs board buy-in)
</triggers>

<principles>
- **Quantify pain in dollars**: "Manual process costs $500K/year" (not "inefficient process")
- **Make CFO's job easy**: Provide ready-to-present business case (not raw data dump)
- **3:1 ROI minimum**: SaaS industry standard (lower ROI = harder to justify)
- **<12 month payback**: CFO wants fast payback (18+ months = harder sell)
- **Link to business outcomes**: Revenue growth, cost reduction, risk mitigation (not technical features)
- **Conservative estimates**: Under-promise, over-deliver (don't oversell ROI)
</principles>

<steps>
1. **Discover cost of current state**:
   - **Labor costs**: How many FTEs spend time on this? (FTE cost = $100K-$150K/year avg)
   - **Opportunity costs**: What revenue/projects are delayed? (quantify in dollars)
   - **Error costs**: How much do mistakes/rework cost? (time + money)
   - **Risk costs**: What's the financial impact of compliance risk, security breach, downtime?
   - **Vendor costs**: What are you paying for current tools/systems?

2. **Calculate total cost of problem**:
   - Formula: `Labor cost + Opportunity cost + Error cost + Risk cost + Vendor cost = Total annual cost`
   - Example: 5 FTE ($125K each) + $200K delayed revenue + $50K errors + $100K risk + $75K vendor = $1.05M/year

3. **Quantify solution value**:
   - **Labor savings**: Reduce 5 FTE to 2 FTE (3 FTE saved = $375K/year)
   - **Opportunity capture**: Accelerate revenue by 20% ($200K → $240K, +$40K)
   - **Error reduction**: Eliminate 90% of errors ($50K → $5K, save $45K)
   - **Risk mitigation**: Reduce compliance risk ($100K → $20K, save $80K)
   - **Vendor consolidation**: Replace 3 tools with 1 ($75K → $0, save $75K)
   - **Total value**: $375K + $40K + $45K + $80K + $75K = $615K/year

4. **Build ROI model**:
   - **Investment**: One-time + recurring costs
     - Example: $200K implementation + $150K annual subscription = $350K Year 1, $150K Year 2+
   - **Annual value**: From step 3 ($615K/year)
   - **Net value Year 1**: $615K - $350K = $265K
   - **Net value Year 2-3**: $615K - $150K = $465K/year
   - **3-year ROI**: ($265K + $465K + $465K) / $350K = 3.4:1 ROI
   - **Payback period**: $350K / $615K = 6.8 months

5. **Create business case presentation** (1-2 pages):
   - **Executive summary**: "Investment of $350K delivers $1.2M value over 3 years (3.4:1 ROI, 7-month payback)"
   - **Current state cost**: Table showing labor, opportunity, errors, risk, vendor costs
   - **Proposed solution value**: Table showing savings/gains per category
   - **Financial summary**: Investment, annual value, net value, ROI, payback
   - **Risks**: What if we don't act? (cost of inaction)
   - **Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation

6. **Enable champion to present**:
   - **Review together**: Walk champion through business case, practice presentation
   - **Provide supporting data**: Detailed calculations, assumptions, reference ROI from similar companies
   - **Offer to attend**: "I can join CFO meeting to answer questions" (support champion)
</steps>

<examples>
<example id="cfo_budget_approval">
**Context**: $500K deal, VP Operations is champion, needs CFO approval for budget

**Situation**: Champion says "CFO wants to see ROI before approving"

**Discovery** (with champion):
- **Current state**:
  - 8 FTE spend 50% of time on manual data entry ($100K avg salary = $50K per FTE = $400K/year)
  - Manual process takes 14 days (delays month-end close, impacts financial reporting)
  - 5% error rate requiring rework (costs 1 FTE = $100K/year)
  - Using 3 legacy tools (total $60K/year licenses)
- **Total cost of current state**: $400K + $100K + $60K = $560K/year

**Proposed solution value**:
- **Labor savings**: Automation reduces manual work by 80% ($400K → $80K = save $320K)
- **Faster close**: Month-end close from 14 days to 3 days (CFO's personal pain point)
- **Error reduction**: Errors from 5% to <0.5% (save $95K/year)
- **Vendor consolidation**: Replace 3 tools with 1 (save $60K/year)
- **Total annual value**: $320K + $95K + $60K = $475K/year

**Investment**:
- Implementation: $100K (one-time)
- Annual subscription: $150K/year
- **Year 1 total**: $250K

**ROI calculation**:
- **Year 1 net value**: $475K - $250K = $225K
- **Year 2-3 net value**: $475K - $150K = $325K/year
- **3-year ROI**: ($225K + $325K + $325K) / $250K = 3.5:1
- **Payback period**: $250K / $475K = 6.3 months

**Business case presentation** (created for champion):
```
Executive Summary: Investment of $250K (Year 1) delivers $875K value over 3 years
- ROI: 3.5:1
- Payback: 6.3 months
- Annual savings: $475K (primarily labor redeployment + error reduction)
- Strategic benefit: Month-end close accelerates from 14 days to 3 days

Current State Costs (Annual):
- Manual labor: $400K (8 FTE x 50% time)
- Errors/rework: $100K
- Legacy tools: $60K
Total: $560K/year

Proposed Solution Value (Annual):
- Labor savings: $320K (redeploy to higher-value work)
- Error reduction: $95K
- Vendor consolidation: $60K
Total: $475K/year

Financial Summary:
Year 1: $475K value - $250K investment = $225K net
Year 2: $475K value - $150K subscription = $325K net
Year 3: $475K value - $150K subscription = $325K net
3-year total: $875K net value on $250K investment (3.5:1 ROI)

Risks of Inaction:
- Continued $560K/year cost (inefficiency persists)
- 14-day month-end close (competitive disadvantage vs 3-5 day peers)
- Error risk (compliance, financial reporting accuracy)

Recommendation: Proceed with implementation (ROI exceeds 3:1 threshold, payback <12 months)
```

**CFO presentation** (champion presented):
- **Min 0-2**: Showed executive summary (3.5:1 ROI, 6.3 month payback)
- **Min 2-5**: Walked through current state costs ($560K/year)
- **Min 5-8**: Showed proposed value ($475K/year savings)
- **Min 8-12**: CFO asked questions (AE attended, provided reference customer ROI data)
- **Min 12-15**: CFO approved budget

**Outcome**: CFO approved $500K (rounded up from $250K Year 1 to include buffer), deal closed

**Key moves**:
- Quantified current state in dollars (not vague "inefficiency")
- Focused on CFO's pain point (14-day close = personal priority)
- Conservative estimates (80% labor savings, not 100%)
- Enabled champion to present (built their credibility with CFO)
- Attended meeting to support (AE didn't own presentation)
</example>

<example id="board_approval_large_deal">
**Context**: $2.5M deal, CEO must present to board for approval

**Situation**: CEO says "Board wants to see strategic rationale and financial return"

**Discovery**:
- **Current state**: Manual processes across 3 departments (Sales, Ops, Finance)
  - Sales: Lead routing takes 48 hours (losing deals to faster competitors)
  - Ops: Fulfillment errors = 8% of orders ($1.2M annual revenue loss)
  - Finance: Month-end close takes 18 days (audit costs $200K extra due to delays)
- **Total cost**: Lost revenue $1.2M + audit costs $200K = $1.4M/year + competitive risk

**Proposed solution value**:
- **Sales acceleration**: Lead routing from 48 hours to 5 minutes (recover $600K lost deals/year)
- **Ops quality**: Errors from 8% to <1% (recover $1M revenue/year)
- **Finance efficiency**: Close from 18 days to 5 days (save $150K audit costs)
- **Strategic**: Competitive advantage (respond to customers 10x faster than peers)
- **Total annual value**: $600K + $1M + $150K = $1.75M/year

**Investment**:
- Implementation: $800K (enterprise-scale, 3 departments)
- Annual subscription: $500K/year
- **Year 1 total**: $1.3M

**ROI calculation**:
- **Year 1 net value**: $1.75M - $1.3M = $450K
- **Year 2-3 net value**: $1.75M - $500K = $1.25M/year
- **3-year ROI**: ($450K + $1.25M + $1.25M) / $1.3M = 2.3:1
- **Payback period**: $1.3M / $1.75M = 8.9 months

**Board presentation** (CEO presented, AE created materials):
- **Slide 1**: Strategic imperative (speed to customer = competitive advantage)
- **Slide 2**: Current state costs ($1.4M/year + risk)
- **Slide 3**: Proposed solution value ($1.75M/year + strategic benefit)
- **Slide 4**: Financial summary (2.3:1 ROI, 9-month payback)
- **Slide 5**: Risk mitigation (pilot complete, reference customers validated ROI)
- **Slide 6**: Recommendation (proceed)

**Board questions**:
- "What if ROI is lower?" → Conservative estimates (used 80% of best-case scenarios)
- "What's implementation risk?" → Pilot validated fit, reference customers averaged 6-month implementation
- "Can we phase it?" → Yes, but ROI delays (full value requires all 3 departments)

**Outcome**: Board approved $2.5M, deal closed

**Key moves**:
- Linked to strategic priority (speed to customer, not just cost savings)
- Quantified revenue impact ($1.6M recovery) not just cost savings
- Conservative ROI (2.3:1, not oversold 5:1)
- Addressed risk proactively (pilot, references, implementation track record)
</example>

<example id="pricing_objection_reframe">
**Context**: $600K deal, champion says "This is expensive, can you come down on price?"

**Situation**: Pricing objection before ROI discussion (need to reframe)

**Response**:
- **AE**: "I understand $600K feels like a big investment. Can I show you the business case?"
- **Champion**: "Sure, but we're tight on budget"

**Quick ROI walkthrough**:
- **AE**: "You mentioned this problem costs 6 FTE ($600K/year). Our solution reduces that to 1 FTE ($100K). That's $500K/year savings."
- **Champion**: "I didn't think of it that way"
- **AE**: "So you're investing $600K to save $500K/year. Payback is 14 months, then $500K/year net savings."
- **Champion**: "When you put it like that, $600K seems reasonable"

**Outcome**: Pricing objection disappeared (reframed as investment, not expense)

**Key moves**:
- Quantified pain (6 FTE = $600K/year)
- Showed payback period (14 months)
- Reframed $600K from "expensive" to "14-month payback on $500K/year savings"
</example>

<example id="cost_of_inaction">
**Context**: $400K deal, champion interested but says "We'll revisit this next quarter"

**Situation**: No urgency, need to quantify cost of delay

**Response**:
- **AE**: "I understand timing is tight. Can I show you the cost of waiting?"

**Cost of inaction analysis**:
- **Current state cost**: $120K/quarter (manual process inefficiency)
- **If we wait 1 quarter**: Lose $120K (opportunity cost)
- **Investment**: $400K
- **Net impact of waiting**: $400K investment + $120K lost opportunity = $520K effective cost (vs $400K if acting now)

**Champion reaction**: "I didn't realize waiting costs us $120K. Let me see if we can move this up."

**Outcome**: Champion prioritized deal, closed in current quarter (urgency created)

**Key moves**:
- Quantified cost of delay ($120K/quarter)
- Reframed "wait until next quarter" as "$120K cost"
- Created urgency (cost of inaction = reason to act now)
</example>

<example id="competing_priorities">
**Context**: $800K deal, CFO says "We have 5 projects competing for $2M budget"

**Situation**: Budget exists, but allocation decision needed

**Response**:
- **AE**: "Can I show you how this project compares to the others on ROI?"

**Comparative ROI analysis**:
- **Project A (ours)**: $800K investment, 2.8:1 ROI, 10-month payback
- **Project B**: $600K investment, 1.5:1 ROI, 18-month payback (internal IT project)
- **Project C**: $400K investment, 2.2:1 ROI, 14-month payback (marketing automation)
- **Project D**: $200K investment, 1.2:1 ROI, 24-month payback (office renovation)

**Recommendation**: Fund Project A + C (highest ROI, fastest payback) = $1.2M of $2M budget

**CFO response**: "This is helpful. I hadn't compared them side-by-side on ROI."

**Outcome**: CFO allocated budget to Project A (ours) + Project C, deal closed

**Key moves**:
- Positioned our deal vs other projects (not in isolation)
- Comparative ROI made decision easy (highest ROI + fastest payback)
- Helped CFO prioritize budget allocation (added value beyond just selling)
</example>
</examples>

<pitfalls>
- **Vague value**: "Improve efficiency" (not quantified) vs "$500K annual savings" (specific)
- **Overselling ROI**: Promising 10:1 ROI = credibility risk (under-promise, over-deliver)
- **Feature-based value**: "AI-powered insights" vs "Reduce decision time from 3 days to 2 hours" (outcomes matter)
- **Ignoring CFO priorities**: Focusing on technical features instead of payback period and ROI
- **No cost of inaction**: Failing to quantify "what if we don't act?" = no urgency
- **Champion left alone**: Expecting champion to build business case without support = weak presentation to CFO
</pitfalls>
