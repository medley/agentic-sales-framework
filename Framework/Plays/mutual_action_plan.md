# Mutual Action Plan (MAP) Play: Joint Buyer-Seller Success Planning

<triggers>
- complex_buying_process (multiple approval stages, long cycle)
- long_sales_cycle (3+ months from qualify to close)
- multiple_approvals (committee, board, procurement, legal, security)
- timeline_slippage_risk (deal dragging, no clear next steps)
- champion_needs_help (champion wants to drive internally but needs structure)
- executive_alignment (exec sponsor wants visibility into progress)
</triggers>

<principles>
- **Joint ownership**: Both parties commit to timeline and milestones (not just vendor pushing)
- **Specific dates**: "CFO review by March 15" (not "CFO review in a few weeks")
- **Named owners**: Every milestone has customer + vendor owner (not vague "team will handle")
- **Weekly reviews**: Check-in cadence to track progress and address blockers
- **Executive sponsors**: Both sides have exec sponsor (ensures accountability)
- **Living document**: Update weekly, not "set and forget"
</principles>

<steps>
1. **Identify need for MAP**:
   - **Good fit**: Complex deals (3+ stakeholders), long cycles (60+ days), multiple approvals
   - **Poor fit**: Simple deals (single buyer, 30-day cycle), transactional purchases
   - **Timing**: Introduce in Stage 2 (Qualify) or Stage 3 (Propose), not Stage 1 (too early)

2. **Co-create with champion**:
   - **Workshop session** (30-45 min with champion):
     - "Let's map out the path to get this approved"
     - Identify all approval gates (technical, business, legal, procurement, exec)
     - Assign dates and owners
   - **Champion involvement is critical**: They own customer-side milestones (not AE dictating)

3. **Structure the MAP** (use template):
   - **Milestone**: What needs to happen
   - **Owner**: Customer lead + Vendor lead
   - **Due Date**: Specific date (not "Week of" or "Mid-month")
   - **Status**: Not Started / In Progress / Completed / Blocked
   - **Notes**: Any blockers or dependencies

4. **Get executive sponsor buy-in**:
   - Present MAP to customer exec sponsor (CFO, CIO, etc.) for approval
   - Exec sponsor commits to timeline and resources
   - AE's exec sponsor (VP Sales, CRO) also commits

5. **Weekly check-ins**:
   - **15-min sync** every Monday (or Friday) with champion
   - Review: What's done? What's blocked? What's next?
   - Update MAP status in real-time
   - Escalate blockers to exec sponsors if needed

6. **Monitor and adapt**:
   - **Green**: All milestones on track
   - **Yellow**: 1-2 milestones slipping, but recoverable
   - **Red**: 3+ milestones delayed or exec sponsor disengaged (deal at risk)
   - **Adapt**: If timeline slips, adjust MAP and re-commit (don't let it go stale)
</steps>

<examples>
<example id="enterprise_complex_map">
**Context**: $2M enterprise deal, 9 stakeholders, estimated 120-day sales cycle

**Situation**: Champion (VP Ops) says "This is going to take a while, lots of approvals"

**Action**: Proposed joint MAP session with champion

**MAP workshop** (45 min with VP Ops):
- **Identified approval gates**:
  1. Technical evaluation (IT team)
  2. Security review (CISO)
  3. Business case approval (CFO)
  4. Legal review (General Counsel)
  5. Procurement negotiation
  6. Board approval (CEO presents)
  7. Contract signature

**Drafted MAP**:

| Milestone | Owner (Customer / Vendor) | Due Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| Technical architecture review | Dir IT / SE | Feb 10 | Not Started |
| Security questionnaire completed | CISO / Security Team | Feb 17 | Not Started |
| Business case presented to CFO | VP Ops / AE | Feb 24 | Not Started |
| CFO approves budget | CFO / AE | Mar 3 | Not Started |
| Legal reviews contract | General Counsel / AE | Mar 10 | Not Started |
| Procurement negotiates terms | Procurement / AE | Mar 17 | Not Started |
| Board approval (CEO presents) | CEO / VP Ops | Mar 24 | Not Started |
| Contract signature | VP Ops / AE | Mar 31 | Not Started |

**Exec sponsor alignment**:
- Customer: VP Ops (champion) + CFO (exec sponsor)
- Vendor: AE + VP Sales (exec sponsor)

**Weekly check-ins**: Every Monday at 10am (15 min)

**Execution**:
- **Week 1**: Technical review completed on time (Feb 10) ✅
- **Week 2**: Security questionnaire delayed 3 days (CISO travel) → adjusted to Feb 20 ⚠️
- **Week 3**: Business case presented to CFO on Feb 24 ✅
- **Week 4**: CFO approved budget early (Mar 1, 2 days ahead) ✅
- **Week 5**: Legal review started Mar 10 ✅
- **Week 6**: Procurement negotiation extended (redlines) → adjusted to Mar 22 ⚠️
- **Week 7**: Board approval delayed (meeting rescheduled) → adjusted to Apr 7 🔴
- **Week 8**: Escalated to exec sponsors (VP Ops + VP Sales) → CEO expedited board approval to Mar 28 ✅
- **Week 9**: Contract signed Mar 30 (1 day early) ✅

**Outcome**: Deal closed in 59 days (vs estimated 120 days) with MAP driving accountability

**Key moves**:
- Co-created MAP with champion (not vendor dictating timeline)
- Weekly check-ins caught delays early (CISO travel, procurement redlines)
- Escalated board delay to exec sponsors (CEO expedited, saved 10 days)
- MAP visibility kept deal on track (champion used it to manage internal stakeholders)
</example>

<example id="map_prevents_slippage">
**Context**: $1.5M deal, no MAP, timeline slipping (deal in Stage 3 for 8 weeks)

**Situation**: Champion says "We're working on it, just need a bit more time" (vague, no urgency)

**Action**: Introduced MAP mid-deal to re-establish timeline

**AE approach**: "Let's map out the remaining steps so we're aligned on what needs to happen"

**MAP created**:

| Milestone | Owner (Customer / Vendor) | Due Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| Finalize technical requirements | IT Director / SE | Week 9 | In Progress |
| Pricing proposal approval | CFO / AE | Week 10 | Not Started |
| Legal contract review | Legal / AE | Week 11 | Not Started |
| Procurement finalization | Procurement / AE | Week 12 | Not Started |
| Signature | Champion / AE | Week 13 | Not Started |

**Champion reaction**: "Oh wow, when you lay it out like this, we're really behind schedule"

**Weekly check-ins started**: Every Friday at 2pm

**Execution**:
- **Week 9**: Technical requirements finalized (delayed from Week 8, but now documented)
- **Week 10**: CFO approved pricing ✅
- **Week 11**: Legal review completed (2 minor redlines) ✅
- **Week 12**: Procurement finalized ✅
- **Week 13**: Contract signed ✅

**Outcome**: Deal closed in 5 weeks after MAP introduced (was stalled for 8 weeks prior)

**Key moves**:
- MAP created visibility into timeline (champion realized they were behind)
- Weekly check-ins created urgency (champion had to report progress)
- MAP prevented further slippage (clear deadlines vs vague "soon")
</example>

<example id="executive_sponsor_disengagement">
**Context**: $1.8M deal with MAP, exec sponsor (CIO) initially engaged, then went silent

**Situation**: MAP shows 3 milestones delayed, champion can't get CIO's time

**Red flag**: Exec sponsor disengagement = deal at risk

**Action**: Escalated to vendor exec sponsor (VP Sales)

**Escalation**:
- VP Sales reached out to CIO (peer-to-peer): "I see we've fallen behind on timeline. Is this still a priority?"
- CIO response: "Yes, but we had internal re-org. Let me re-engage."
- CIO assigned new owner (Dir IT) and re-committed to MAP timeline

**Outcome**: Deal recovered, closed 3 weeks later (exec re-engagement saved the deal)

**Key moves**:
- MAP visibility flagged exec disengagement early (not months later)
- Vendor exec sponsor escalated (peer-to-peer CIO outreach)
- Re-committed to MAP with new owner (Dir IT)
</example>

<example id="map_for_champion_enablement">
**Context**: $900K deal, champion (IT Manager) wants to drive deal but struggling with internal approvals

**Situation**: Champion says "I don't know how to get this through procurement and legal"

**Action**: Used MAP as champion enablement tool

**MAP co-creation**:
- **AE**: "Let's map out who needs to approve and when"
- **Champion**: "I've never done this before, I don't know the process"
- **AE**: "No problem, let's draft it together and you can validate with your boss"

**Drafted MAP**:

| Milestone | Owner (Customer / Vendor) | Due Date | Status |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|--------|
| IT Manager presents to CIO | IT Manager / AE | Week 1 | Not Started |
| CIO approves budget | CIO / AE | Week 2 | Not Started |
| Submit to procurement | IT Manager / AE | Week 3 | Not Started |
| Procurement reviews vendor | Procurement / AE | Week 4 | Not Started |
| Legal reviews contract | Legal / AE | Week 5 | Not Started |
| Signature | IT Manager / AE | Week 6 | Not Started |

**Champion reaction**: "This is super helpful, I'll show this to my CIO"

**CIO response**: "This looks great, let's execute on this timeline"

**Outcome**: MAP gave champion structure to navigate internal approvals, deal closed in 6 weeks

**Key moves**:
- MAP served as internal selling tool for champion (showed CIO the plan)
- Champion learned approval process (enablement, not just deal tool)
- CIO approved MAP = commitment to timeline (not vague support)
</example>

<example id="map_rejection">
**Context**: $700K deal, proposed MAP, champion rejected it

**Situation**: Champion says "We don't work that way, we'll just handle it internally"

**Red flag**: Rejection of MAP = lack of commitment or hiding something

**Action**: Tested champion commitment

**AE response**: "I understand. Can you at least share the internal approval process and timeline?"

**Champion**: "I don't have that information yet"

**Follow-up**: "When do you think you'll have a timeline? I want to make sure we support you."

**Champion**: "I'm not sure, we're still figuring it out"

**Diagnosis**: Champion is not driving internally (weak champion) or deal is not prioritized

**Outcome**: Deal stalled for 6 weeks, eventually lost to competitor who had stronger champion

**Key moves**:
- MAP rejection was early warning signal (champion not committed)
- Tested champion with follow-up questions (confirmed weak champion)
- Should have pivoted to find stronger champion or disqualified earlier
</example>
</examples>

<pitfalls>
- **Vendor-only ownership**: MAP with only vendor driving = not mutual, customer won't commit
- **Vague milestones**: "Legal review sometime in March" (not specific) = no accountability
- **Set and forget**: Creating MAP but never updating = wasted effort, stale document
- **Too complex**: 30+ milestones = overwhelming, nobody will use it (keep to 6-10 major milestones)
- **No exec sponsor**: MAP without exec buy-in = champion can't enforce timeline
- **Introducing too early**: MAP in Stage 1 (Discovery) = premature, buyer isn't committed yet
</pitfalls>
