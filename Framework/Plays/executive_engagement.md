# Executive Engagement Play: Economic Buyer Access Strategy

<triggers>
- no_economic_buyer (stuck with manager/director, no C-level access)
- stuck_with_mid_level (champion can't get budget approval)
- budget_authority_unclear (who actually signs the contract?)
- stage_3_without_eb (Propose stage but no exec engagement)
- pricing_objection (mid-level says "too expensive" without exec context)
- timeline_slippage (deal dragging, need exec sponsor to accelerate)
</triggers>

<principles>
- **Warm intro > cold outreach**: Get champion to introduce you, don't bypass them
- **WIIFM (What's In It For Me)**: Exec cares about business outcomes, not features
- **Time-box ruthlessly**: 15-20 min max, execs have no patience for rambling
- **Prep is everything**: Know their priorities, earnings calls, strategic initiatives
- **3-slide rule**: Exec briefing fits on 3 slides (problem, solution, proof)
- **Mutual value**: Offer insight/benchmark data, don't just ask for things
</principles>

<steps>
1. **Identify the Economic Buyer**:
   - Who has budget authority for this purchase? (title + name)
   - Confirm with champion: "Who needs to approve a $500K investment?"
   - LinkedIn: Check reporting structure, find decision-maker

2. **Get warm introduction**:
   - Ask champion: "Would you be comfortable introducing me to [CFO/CIO] for a 15-min business review?"
   - Offer air cover: "I can draft the intro email for you"
   - Alternative: Ask for meeting invite with champion + exec together

3. **Prepare executive briefing** (3 slides):
   - **Slide 1**: Their business problem in their words (cite champion's pain points)
   - **Slide 2**: Proposed solution with quantified business outcomes (revenue impact, cost savings, risk reduction)
   - **Slide 3**: Social proof (similar company, similar results) + proposed next steps

4. **Research the executive**:
   - Recent earnings calls, LinkedIn posts, company priorities
   - Industry trends affecting their role
   - Prepare 2-3 strategic questions (not interrogation)

5. **Conduct executive meeting**:
   - **First 2 minutes**: Thank them, state agenda, confirm time limit
   - **Next 5 minutes**: Present 3-slide briefing (crisp, no jargon)
   - **Next 5 minutes**: Ask strategic questions, listen for priorities
   - **Last 3 minutes**: Agree on next steps (timeline, stakeholders, success criteria)

6. **Follow up same day**:
   - Send summary email within 2 hours
   - Include: What you heard (validate understanding), agreed next steps, owner + deadline
   - CC champion to keep them in the loop
</steps>

<example id="cfo_budget_approval">
**Context**: $800K deal, VP Operations is champion, but CFO hasn't been engaged yet (Stage 3)

**Situation**: VP Ops says "I love this, but I need CFO approval for anything over $500K"

**Action**:
- **Requested intro**: "Would you introduce me to your CFO for a 15-min business case review?"
- **Drafted intro email** for VP Ops to send:
  ```
  [CFO], I've been working with [Vendor] on [problem]. They've helped [Reference Company]
  achieve [outcome]. I think a quick 15-min call would be valuable to review the business case
  before we proceed. Are you open to a brief call next week?
  ```
- **CFO agreed** to 20-min call

**Prep work**:
- Reviewed CFO's LinkedIn (former McKinsey consultant, process efficiency focus)
- Checked recent earnings call (CEO mentioned "operational excellence initiative")
- Created 3-slide deck:
  1. Problem: "Manual process costing 5 FTE, 12-day cycle time, error-prone"
  2. Solution: "Automate workflow, reduce to 3 days, eliminate errors, redeploy 3 FTE to higher-value work"
  3. Proof: "[Reference Company] achieved $1.2M annual savings, 18-month payback"

**Executive meeting** (18 minutes):
- **Min 0-2**: "Thanks for your time. I know you're focused on operational excellence. I'll keep this to 15 minutes and focus on business outcomes."
- **Min 2-7**: Walked through 3 slides, emphasized FTE redeployment and payback period
- **Min 7-12**: Asked CFO: "What's your threshold for investment payback?" (Answer: <24 months)
- **Min 12-18**: CFO asked about implementation risk, I cited reference's 4-month implementation
- **Outcome**: CFO said "If [VP Ops] is confident in the ROI, I'll approve. Send me the proposal."

**Follow-up email** (sent 90 min after call):
```
[CFO], thanks for the time today. Key takeaways:
- Your payback threshold: <24 months (we're projecting 18 months)
- Your concern: Implementation risk (our avg is 4 months, [Reference] was 3.5 months)
- Next steps: I'll send proposal to [VP Ops] by Friday, you'll review next week

Please let me know if I missed anything. Appreciate your partnership.
```

**Outcome**: CFO approved within 1 week, deal closed at $800K ACV

**Key moves**:
- Warm intro from champion (not cold outreach to CFO)
- Researched CFO's priorities (operational excellence = perfect fit)
- Quantified outcomes in CFO language (payback period, FTE savings, not features)
- Time-boxed meeting (18 min vs scheduled 20 min = respect for exec's time)
</example>

<example id="cio_stuck_mid_level">
**Context**: $1.2M infrastructure deal, IT Director is champion, but CIO hasn't been engaged (6 weeks in)

**Situation**: IT Director says "CIO is swamped, let's just move forward without him" (RED FLAG)

**Action**:
- **Pushed back**: "I appreciate that, but CIO approval is critical for a $1.2M investment. Let's get 15 min on his calendar."
- **Offered value**: "I'll share benchmarking data from similar companies - this might be useful context for him."
- **Champion agreed** to intro, positioned as "strategic review" not "sales pitch"

**Prep work**:
- Researched CIO's background (former startup CTO, cloud migration advocate)
- Found recent interview where CIO said "legacy infrastructure is our #1 bottleneck"
- Created benchmarking deck:
  1. Industry benchmark: "Peers spend 18% of IT budget on infrastructure, you're at 28%"
  2. Proposed approach: "Modernize stack, reduce to 15% over 2 years, redeploy savings to product innovation"
  3. Risk mitigation: "Phased migration, zero downtime, 6-month pilot"

**Executive meeting** (15 minutes):
- **Min 0-2**: "I know legacy infrastructure is a priority. I brought benchmark data that might be useful."
- **Min 2-5**: Shared industry benchmark (CIO didn't know they were 10% above peers)
- **Min 5-10**: CIO asked about migration risk (his #1 concern). Discussed phased approach, pilot plan.
- **Min 10-15**: CIO said "I like the pilot approach. Let's start small and prove it out."

**Outcome**: CIO became active sponsor, deal restructured as $400K pilot + $800K expansion (total $1.2M over 18 months)

**Key moves**:
- Brought value (benchmark data) not just "ask" (avoided feeling like sales pitch)
- Researched CIO's priorities (cloud migration, infrastructure bottleneck)
- Addressed CIO's #1 concern (migration risk) with phased approach
- Pilot structure de-risked decision, got CIO buy-in
</example>

<example id="ceo_strategic_initiative">
**Context**: $2M deal with enterprise, CFO and CIO both engaged, but deal feels "nice to have" not "must have"

**Situation**: Deal has been in stage 4 (Select) for 8 weeks, no urgency, timeline slipping

**Action**:
- **Hypothesis**: Missing CEO-level strategic alignment (no compelling event)
- **Asked champion** (CIO): "Is this project tied to any board-level initiative?"
- **Champion revealed**: "CEO announced 'digital transformation' as top 3 priority for the year"
- **Requested**: "Can we get 10 minutes with CEO to align this project to digital transformation goals?"

**Prep work**:
- Reviewed CEO's shareholder letter (mentioned "customer experience modernization")
- Created 2-slide "strategic alignment" deck:
  1. CEO's goal: "Modernize customer experience to compete with digital-native competitors"
  2. This project: "Foundational infrastructure to enable customer-facing innovation (CRM, mobile app, self-service portal)"

**Executive meeting** (12 minutes with CEO, CFO, CIO present):
- **Min 0-2**: "Thanks for the time. I know customer experience modernization is a priority. I wanted to show how this infrastructure project enables that."
- **Min 2-6**: Walked through strategic alignment (CEO's eyes lit up when he saw connection to his priorities)
- **Min 6-10**: CEO asked: "How fast can we do this?" (urgency created!)
- **Min 10-12**: Agreed on 6-month timeline, CEO assigned CIO as exec sponsor with monthly updates to CEO

**Outcome**: Deal accelerated from 8-week stall to contract signed in 3 weeks (CEO urgency cascaded down)

**Key moves**:
- Connected deal to CEO's strategic priorities (not just IT project)
- Short meeting (12 min) focused on strategic fit, not technical details
- CEO urgency created compelling event (monthly updates to CEO = deadline pressure)
</example>

<example id="bypass_recovery">
**Context**: $600K deal, AE cold-emailed CMO, champion (Marketing Director) found out and felt bypassed

**Situation**: Champion said "I thought we had a partnership, why did you go around me?" (relationship damaged)

**Action** (damage control):
- **Immediate apology call**: "I made a mistake. I should have asked you first. I'm sorry."
- **Explained intent**: "I was trying to get exec buy-in to help you get budget approval, but I went about it wrong."
- **Asked for guidance**: "How would you like me to engage your CMO? I'll follow your lead."
- **Champion appreciated** candor, agreed to set up joint meeting (Champion + CMO + AE)

**Joint meeting approach**:
- Champion presented the business case (not AE)
- AE supported with data and social proof
- CMO asked questions, AE answered, but Champion was the "seller"
- CMO approved budget, Champion felt ownership (relationship repaired)

**Outcome**: Deal closed at $600K, Champion remained strong advocate (could have lost deal entirely)

**Key moves**:
- Immediate apology (no excuses, owned the mistake)
- Let champion lead the exec conversation (restored their ownership)
- Learned lesson: ALWAYS get champion's permission before exec outreach
</example>

<example id="no_champion_cold_exec">
**Context**: New deal, no champion identified yet, considering cold outreach to VP Sales

**Situation**: Should I cold-email the VP Sales or find a champion first?

**Decision**: Find champion first (avoid bypass risk)

**Action**:
- **Targeted mid-level**: Reached out to Sales Operations Manager (likely to feel pain point)
- **First meeting**: Diagnosed pain, built rapport, offered to help (no sales pitch)
- **Second meeting**: Shared how peers solve this problem, Ops Manager got excited
- **Third meeting**: Ops Manager said "I want to bring this to my VP, can you help me build the case?"
- **Jointly drafted** 1-pager for VP with business case
- **Ops Manager introduced** AE to VP in email with business case attached

**Outcome**: VP meeting went smoothly (Ops Manager was internal champion), deal progressed with strong champion relationship

**Key moves**:
- Avoided cold exec outreach (built champion relationship first)
- Enabled champion to "sell" internally (they built the business case)
- Warm intro to VP was far more effective than cold email
</example>
</examples>

<pitfalls>
- **Bypassing champion**: Going around champion to exec = damaged relationship, lost trust
- **Cold outreach to exec**: Emailing CEO without internal sponsor = low response rate, feels transactional
- **Feature dumping**: Presenting technical features to exec instead of business outcomes = lost attention
- **No time limit**: Scheduling 60-min meeting with exec = they'll cancel or cut it short
- **Winging it**: Not researching exec's priorities = generic pitch, no resonance
- **Asking for too much**: "Can I get 30 min with your CEO to discuss our platform?" = tone-deaf, selfish
</pitfalls>
