# Key techniques
techniques:
  pain_funnel:
    - "Tell me more about that..."
    - "Can you be more specific? Give me an example."
    - "How long has that been a problem?"
    - "What have you tried to do about that?"
    - "And did that work?"
    - "How much do you think that has cost you?"
    - "How do you feel about that?"
    - "Have you given up trying to deal with the problem?"

  budget_approaches:
    - "Third-Party Story: Share similar costs, ask if comfortable in range"
    - "Bracketing: Provide range, ask where they fall"
    - "Direct Ask: In round numbers, what amount do you have in mind?"

  decision_mapping:
    - "Newspaper Reporter: Who, What, When, Where, How, Why"
    - "Cast of Characters: Map all participants with roles, pains, sentiment"
    - "Timeline Identifier: Work backward from implementation date"

  negative_reverse:
    - "It may not be a fit"
    - "I'm not sure we can help you"
    - "You should tell me 'no' if you're not 100% comfortable"

# Crosswalk to default methodology
crosswalk_to_default:
  - sandler_stage: "Bonding & Rapport"
    default_stage: "All stages (foundation)"
    notes: "Sandler treats as continuous; default may not explicitly track"

  - sandler_stage: "Up-Front Contracts"
    default_stage: "All stages (foundation)"
    notes: "Sandler establishes contract per interaction; default may assume agenda"

  - sandler_stage: "Pain"
    default_stage: "Stage 1: Discover"
    notes: "Sandler requires emotional commitment; default may accept intellectual interest"

  - sandler_stage: "Budget"
    default_stage: "Stage 3: Propose"
    notes: "Sandler discusses BEFORE proposal; default often after"

  - sandler_stage: "Decision"
    default_stage: "Stage 4: Select"
    notes: "Sandler maps process before competing; default may navigate during selection"

  - sandler_stage: "Fulfillment"
    default_stage: "Stages 3-4: Propose/Select"
    notes: "Sandler presents AFTER qualification; default may present earlier"

  - sandler_stage: "Post-Sell"
    default_stage: "Stage 7: Won + beyond"
    notes: "Sandler emphasizes buyer's remorse prevention; default focuses on handover"

# Usage notes
usage_notes:
  best_for:
    - "Complex B2B sales with multiple decision makers"
    - "High-value deals where qualification ROI is high"
    - "Sales cycles where 'tire-kickers' waste significant time"
    - "Industries where buyer's remorse or deal fallout is common"

  avoid_when:
    - "Transactional, low-value sales (overhead too high)"
    - "Single-decision-maker scenarios (less qualification needed)"
    - "Product-led growth models (buyer self-qualifies)"

  common_pitfalls:
    - "Presenting too early (before Pain/Budget/Decision complete)"
    - "Accepting intellectual vs. emotional commitment"
    - "Free consulting (detailed solutions without budget confirmation)"
    - "Skipping up-front contracts (making assumptions)"
    - "Ignoring disqualification signals"
